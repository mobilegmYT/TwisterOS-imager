# TwisterOS-imager
Fork of RPI Imager with TwisterOS added for the website. NOTE: The TwisterOS image is only updated every few releases, so make sure you are up-to-date by running "Twister OS Patcher" after you flash it and boot your pi.

This will be decapitated soon as TwisterOS is being integrated into rpi-imager itself.
